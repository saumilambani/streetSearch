# streetSearch
Currently, street easy does not allow you to : 
1. Find all listings after on or after a given date
2. Does not remember the listings you have already seen, so as to suggest only new listings

This script allows filtering of listings to a given move in date or later and after the initial run, only provides you with new listings.
